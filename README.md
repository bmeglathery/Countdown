# Countdown
This project is an extension of an in-class exercise, to be submitted as an assignment for CS341 - Mobile App Development.
The user may begin up to three 'Countdown' timers, with the target date/time selected via Android's built-in DatePicker and TimePicker widgets.

### Known Bugs
[10/7/17] User cannot select a date more than about 2 and a half months past the current date..
Selecting "Resume Countdown" without having a stored state will show a countdown of some negative 17000 days..
